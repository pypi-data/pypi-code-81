class Transaction:
	"""Transaction manager.  Every Helper should have one.

	Parameters
	----------
	helper : Helper
		The helper for which to manage transactions.

	autocontext : bool or None, default=None
		Whether to automatically control transaction on contexts.

	Glossary
	--------
	transaction control query
		One of the "BEGIN", "COMMIT", "ROLLBACK", "SAVEPOINT", and "RELEASE
		SAVEPOINT" queries or variants, which allows transaction control.  It
		should be an explicit query, i.e., not, e.g., a commit through the
		backend connector's `commit` method.

	active query
		A query, not being a transaction control query, that has been executed
		but neither committed nor rolled back.

	explicit (active) transaction
		A sequence of active queries that was preceded by a "BEGIN" query.

	implicit (active) transaction
		A sequence of active queries that was not preceded by a "BEGIN" query.

	active savepoint
		A savepoint that has been created and not released, within an explicit
		active transaction.

	transaction segment
		A maximal sequence of active queries, not including transaction control
		queries, delimited by an explicit or implicit transaction start, or the
		creation of an active savepoint.  There always is a (possibly empty)
		transaction segment, which correspond to an implicit transaction.  When
		an explicit transaction is started (by a "BEGIN" query), we consider
		that there are two transactions segments:  a first one for the implicit
		transaction that occurs before the just-started explicit one, and one
		for the explicit transaction, although the start of such an explicit
		transaction implies a commit of the implicit transaction.

	Attributes
	----------
	active : bool (property)
		Whether there currently is an explicit active transaction.  This is
		equivalent to having the list attribute `query_count` longer than 1.

	dialect: Dialect (property)
		The SQL dialect to use.  It is inherited from `helper`.

	helper : Helper
		The helper for which to manage transactions.

	query_count : list[int]
		Counters of active queries, by transaction segments.  The first item
		always exists and equals the number of queries performed out of the
		current running transaction — it is reset on each transaction start, so
		it might be non zero only if the list has length one.  In particular,
		if there is no active transaction, this item is the only item of the
		list.  If a transaction is active, then there is a second item which
		equals the number of active queries executed after the transaction
		start and before the first active savepoint, if any, or until now,
		otherwise.  The subsequent items indicate the numbers of active queries
		executed between consecutive active savepoints.  In particular, if no
		savepoint has been created but a transaction is active, the list has
		length exactly 2.  An active savepoint is a savepoint within the active
		transaction that has not be released.  Notice that rollbacking to a
		savepoint does not release it, that is, the savepoint remains active
		after this partial rollback.  However, this operation releases every
		active savepoint that have been created within the rolled back
		transaction segment.

	savepoints : list[str]
		The ordered list of active savepoints of the running transaction.  The
		list length always equals the length of `query_count` minus 2, unless
		there currently is no explicit transaction.  Indeed, within an explicit
		transaction, each savepoint starts a new transaction segment, and there
		are two more transaction segments:  the first one (corresponding to an
		implicit transaction out from the explicit transaction), and the second
		one (which has been started by the "BEGIN" query that initialized the
		current explicit transaction).  In absence of explicit transaction, the
		list is empty:  savepoints can exist only in explicit transactions.

	subcontexts : list[int or None]
		For each current context (which can be nested whence the list), the
		specification of the transaction segment start that occur at context
		entrance or just before.  The value `-1` indicates that the transaction
		segment that was started at context entrance is the current transaction
		beginning.  Other integer value indicate the index in `savepoints` of
		the active savepoint that has been created by the context management
		(i.e., within `__enter__` method) for the context.  Finally, the value
		`None` indicates that no transaction segment is under control for the
		context.

	mode : str or None
		The SQL transaction mode with which the active transaction has been
		started, if there is an active transaction, or with which to start the
		next transaction, otherwise.  (After ending the next transaction, the
		mode is reset to `None`.)

	oncontext : int or None or str
		Specifies how transaction is controlled when entering a context.  If
		`0` then no transaction control is performed.  If `1` then a minimal
		transaction control is performed, namely, nothing more than starting a
		transaction if none is active is performed.  If `2` then a intermediate
		transaction control is performed:  a transaction is started if none is
		active, a savepoint is created otherwise, unless no queries has been
		executed in the transaction segment.  In which case, there is indeed no
		need to create a savepoint, as rolling back to the preceding savepoint
		if any, or the transaction start, otherwise, does the rollback job.
		Finally, if `3` or more, then a full transaction control is performed,
		each context entering produces a transaction start or a savepoint
		creation, according to whether no transaction is active.  Alternatively
		the attribute may have a string value, implying level `3` behavior, but
		with a specific savepoint name given.  If left unspecified, then the
		default value is taken from the `autocontext` attribute — see below.
		The `oncontext` mode applies to the next context to enter only.  After
		use, it is set to the default `autocontext` value.

	autocontext : int
		Default value for `oncontext` attribute, when missing.

	deferred : list[int]
		The ordered list of deferred transaction segment starts.  If `-1`, the
		deferred transaction segment start is a transaction begin.  Otherwise,
		it is the savepoint creation at corresponding index in `savepoints`.

	deferrable : bool
		Whether transaction start and savepoint creations are deferred to avoid
		empty transactions or transaction segments, or not.

		The helper that describes the DB to connect.

	query : SelectQuery
		The query that produces the results of the iterable.

	index : int or None, default=None
		Whether to project the result on a single column, specified by the

	Notes:
	------
	The length of the iterable is available through the method `len`.  Since

	is automatically called by some constructors, such as `list`.
